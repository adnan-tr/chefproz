# ChefPro Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented for the ChefPro application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Client Priority Field

**Issue:** The client edit form was trying to update a 'priority' field that didn't exist in the database schema, causing a 400 Bad Request error.

**Fix:** Added a 'priority' column to the clients table with a default value of 'medium'.

**Implementation:**
- Created SQL script (`add_priority_to_clients.sql`) to add the priority column
- Created TypeScript script (`addPriorityToClients.ts`) to execute the SQL

### 2. Quotation Confirmation Workflow

**Issue:** When a quotation was in 'accepted' status, the "confirm as order" popup was not appearing.

**Fix:** Updated the quotation confirmation workflow to properly handle both 'accepted' and 'confirm_order' statuses.

**Implementation:**
- Modified the `handleConvertToOrder` function to properly handle both statuses
- Updated the UI button to show different text and color based on the status:
  - For 'accepted' quotations: Orange button with "Confirm Order" text
  - For 'confirm_order' quotations: Green button with "Convert to Order" text

## How to Apply the Fixes

### 1. Add Priority Field to Clients Table

To add the 'priority' field to the clients table, run the following command:

```bash
# Set your Supabase service key
$env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-service-key"

# Run the script
npx ts-node addPriorityToClients.ts
```

### 2. Quotation Confirmation Workflow

The fixes for the quotation confirmation workflow have been applied directly to the `QuotationBuilderPage.tsx` file. The changes include:

1. Updated `handleConvertToOrder` function to properly handle both 'accepted' and 'confirm_order' statuses
2. Updated the UI button to show different text and color based on the status

## Verification

After applying the fixes, verify that:

1. You can edit clients and set their priority without errors
2. When a quotation is 'accepted', clicking the "Confirm Order" button changes its status to 'confirm_order'
3. When a quotation is in 'confirm_order' status, clicking the "Convert to Order" button opens the confirmation modal
